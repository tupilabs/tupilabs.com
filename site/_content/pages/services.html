We love creating useful products. And we have a broad range of services to help you to craft an awesome solution too! Take a look at some of the services provided by TupiLabs.
<div class="box">
<h3>Software development</h3>
At TupiLabs we write software in <strong>several programming languages</strong> (Java, PHP, Python, Lua, Perl), using different tools and techniques. You can contact us for preparing an <strong>agile development environment</strong> (with Jenkins, Sonar, git, Maven), planning your <strong>code versioning structure</strong> or for <strong>writing software</strong>.

We have experience working in <strong>distributed teamsdifferent time zones</strong> and with <strong>different cultures and technologies</strong>. Our expertise includes both <strong>backend and frontend software</strong>, varying from CRM and web sites, to <a title="Apache Hadoop" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> clusters processing big data and VAS middlewares in mobile carriers.

We expect to be challenged to craft <strong>fun and interesting solutions</strong>, that will be helpful to many people.

<h3>Software quality</h3>
During different cycles of your project, you may be questioned about the <strong>code quality</strong>. Or you can question yourself about the quality of the code wrote by you and your team. We have large experience in software quality, including <strong>code analysis</strong> and <strong>testing</strong>.

TupiLabs can work together with you preparing an <strong>environment for software quality</strong>, <strong>training</strong> your team or writing <strong>manual and automated tests</strong>. We contribute to <a title="TestLink" href="http://www.teamst.org">TestLink</a> and we created <a title="Jenkins TestLink Plug-inhttps://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin">Jenkins TestLink Plug-in</a>, a plug-in for <a title="Jenkins CI" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin">Jenkins</a> that lets you integrate both TestLink and Jenkins. This way you manage your tests in one single tool. We can help you setting up your environment for this integration or with customization.

<h3>Continuous integration</h3>
Having to work with <strong>different programming languages</strong> at TupiLabs permit us to explore the diversity of existing ways to <strong>build software</strong>. Our preference is <strong>Jenkins</strong> build server, but we work with other servers too.

Our services for continuous integration include <strong>training</strong>, <strong>environment set up</strong>, <strong>integration</strong> with other tools and writing <strong>plug-ins</strong> and <strong>scripts</strong>.

Is your building taking hours to compile a simple web application? Are you having to create more and more nodes to be able to build your software? Having problems finding a perfect set up for your software? While it means headache for majority, this is where we have fun, solving problems like these and helping you to build your software better.

<h3>Translation</h3>
Having your software translated to <strong>different languages</strong> can attract more users and give a better impression of the software maturity. TupiLabs is a Brazilian company, and <strong>Brazilian Portuguese</strong> is our principal language. However, all the software that we create is written in <strong>English</strong>.

We contribute to Open Source software translating the software and documentation to/from Brazilian Portuguese, English and <strong>Spanish</strong>. We have contacts that can help with translation to <strong>Japanese</strong>, <strong>German</strong> and <strong>French</strong> too.

It is important to notice that for official documents you will need a certified translator. But for <strong>games</strong>, <strong>software</strong> and <strong>documentation</strong>, feel free to drop us a message.

<h3>Open Source</h3>
TupiLabs can partner with your team and work on existing issues in Open Source libraries or tools used at the software you are building. If you don't feel confident enough to choose an Open Source solution, TupiLabs can help by <strong>creating patches</strong> for your bugs, <strong>writing new features</strong>, <strong>writing documentation</strong> or <strong>training</strong>.

We also provide an exclusive service of <strong>project assessment</strong>, where we can quickly delivery a report with an assessment of your project. This assessment includes topics such as community, documentation, ease of code maintainability or strictness to Open Source principles.
