<p>Since it was created in 2011 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, TupiLabs has thought about you. Our first product was <strong>Garagem Vaga</strong>. An application to help drivers looking for garages in Brazil. Then we created <strong>Speak Like A Brazilian</strong>, thinking about foreigners coming to Brazil.</p>

<p>We already have other applications being built, but that's not all. We also contribute to a lot of <strong>Open Source</strong> projects. Maybe your favorite application uses a piece of code contributed or started by TupiLabs.</p>

<p>Do you have an awesome <strong>idea</strong> but don't know how to get started? Drop us a message and work with us. Or take a look at some of our ideas, it may help you to have other ideas, or you can work on these ideas and help other people too.</p>
