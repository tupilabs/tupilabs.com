<h2><img title="Garagem Vaga" src="{{site.base_url}}assets/gv-24x24.png" alt="Garagem Vaga" width="24" height="24" />Â Garagem Vaga</h2>
<em><a href="http://www.garagemvaga.com.br">http://www.garagemvaga.com.br</a></em>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Garagem Vaga" href="http://www.garagemvaga.com.br">Garagem Vaga</a> is a web site where people can offer and rent parking lots. It is a free service for all Brazilians. The web site is entirely in Portuguese, and it uses Google Maps for helping the users to find garages. Any user can search for an address and then drag the map to different locations to see the parking lots available in that region. Besides the web site, there is a mobile application being developed for Garagem Vaga.</p>

<h2>BioUno</h2>
<em><a title="BioUno" href="http://www.biouno.org">http://www.biouno.org</a></em>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="BioUno" href="http://www.biouno.org">BioUno</a> is a biology workflow system built on top of <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a>. Jenkins provides the support for scheduling and monitoring jobs, as well as sending notifications and displaying pretty reports, graphs and trees. It is a web application, where the users are able to check the current status of their jobs submissions, as well as schedule new ones (when they have the proper permissions in their profiles). Jenkins is independent of the structure chosen for running biotechnology tools. It means that if you are running Hadoop, a Beowulf cluster with MPI, or any other model, BioUno will simply call the tool, independent of this model. This product was created after we met in a pub with an Irish friend of us, and he told us that he was having issues to use Cornell BioHPC.</p>

<h2>CJAN.org</h2>
<em><a title="CJAN" href="http://www.cjan.org">http://www.cjan.org</a></em>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="CJAN" href="http://www.cjan.org">CJAN.org</a> was inspired by CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. The site is being created internally and will be deployed soon. It will be a mix of java.net (but hopefully without the infrastructure issues) and a Maven repository. Let us know if you are interested in helping us, we will ask for help for CPAN gurus later, like <a title="brian d foy" href="http://www252.pair.com/~comdog/">brian d foy</a>. Our goal is learn with CPAN, and see what can be done to avoid mistakes and deliver an awesome product for the Java community.</p>

<h2>Speak Like A Brazilian</h2>
<em><a title='Speak Like A Brazilian' href='http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com'>http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com</a></em>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During drink ups with gringos, or while sharing a hostel room with them, Brazilians are often surprised when they try to translate a Brazilian saying or expression to Entligh but no one understands them. Brazil is one of the largest countries in the world, and due to its diversity (cultural and people) there is a plethora of different ways of saying the same thing. <a title='Speak Like A Brazilian' href='http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com'>Speak Like A Brazilian</a> was created to help gringos coming to Brazil that would like to use or understand some local expression. Hope y'all enjoy it!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many other products are being developed internally and will be released in 2012! Stay tuned!</p>
