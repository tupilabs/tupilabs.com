<p>TupiLabs welcomes you, from anywhere. We are a global company created <a href="{{site.base_url}}for_you" title="TupiLabs was created for you">for you</a>, looking for ideas and ways to make your life better. We are 'do-ers', and we love to mix computers with other areas, such as data science, biology, literature or music. </p>

<h2 class="center">Innovation and Open Source</h2>

<p>Our <a href="{{site.base_url}}meet-the-team/" title="Meet the team">team</a> is comprised of people from different culture and working in different areas. This enables us to create innovative applications, and we love Open Source, so most of our work is published as <a href="{{site.base_url}}open-source/" title="Open Source">Open Source</a>, usually under permissive licenses.</p>
