<h3>On demand corporate solutions development<img src="{{site.base_url}}img/logos/tupilabs.png" alt="" title="TupiLabs logo" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft" /></h3>

<p>Work with Open Source does not mean only cost reduction and free software. There is a commitment to the community, the quality of the software delivered, the understanding of how to deal and in particular collaborate with different people from different cultures and countries.</p>

<p>TupiLabs believes that it is possible to deliver corporate software, with open or closed source, with the same quality as Open Source code. We encourage companies that work with us to permit opening part of their software. This brings a good image to the company, and ultimately allows the code to be used, reviewed and tested by more people, increasing its quality.</p>

<p>We work with different programming languages, such as Python, PHP, Java and Perl. We use various tools to assist building software, such as Jenkins, Maven, Ant, nose, Test::More, Selenium, Sonar and others, depending on the requirements of each project. We aim for transparency and agility by working closely with our customers and by adopting good practices.</p>
