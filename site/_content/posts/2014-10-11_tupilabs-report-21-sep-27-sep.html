This is a weekly report that we publish every week, with news from 21-Sep to 27-Sep. 

- Tackling some issues of the [BioUno UnoChoice Plug-in](https://github.com/biouno/uno-choice-plugin/), though we realized that it would be simpler to rewrite the Java and Javascript layers, adding more quality before releasing 1.0 to Jenkins users
- Created [branch 1.0](https://github.com/biouno/uno-choice-plugin/tree/1.0) and started working towards unochoice-1.0
- [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-789](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-789)
- [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-699](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JENA-699)

We are working [for you]({{site.base_url}}for_you/)

Have a great week! :-)
