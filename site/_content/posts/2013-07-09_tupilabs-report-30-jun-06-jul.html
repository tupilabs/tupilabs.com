Here's the list of the cool things that happened at **TupiLabs** since last Sunday.

- Tried to call some attention over [Jenkins NUnit Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NUnit+Plugin) 
and its issues and pull requests in the developers mailing-list
- Started to work on Jenkins Meetup Sao Paulo 2013 
- Re-added Google Analytics to our web sites
- Finished the demo+slides for [TDC2013 SP](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2013/index.html#saopaulo)
- Created Twitter Bot [@ASF_Releases](https://twitter.com/asf_releases)

We are working [for you]({{site.base_url}}for_you/)

Have a great week! :-)
