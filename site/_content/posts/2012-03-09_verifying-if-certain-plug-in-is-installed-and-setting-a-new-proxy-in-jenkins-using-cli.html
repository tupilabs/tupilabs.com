What ho lads!

Few days ago I was talking with Olivier Renault [1] about few things that he needs to deploy JinFeng [1] using a non-interactive command line. JinFeng is an integration and testing platform built on top of many Open Source tools, like TestLink [2] and Jenkins [3]. One of the features he needs is Test Steps in TestLink XML-RPC API (I'm working on this, and hopefully will be able to provide a patch for TestLink 1.9.4).

<h2>Installing plug-ins from command line</h2>
Jenkins only needs a JVM to be executed but JinFeng also needs TestLink plug-in installed. So the trick here is to use Jenkins CLI [4] to tell Jenkins we want it to download and install the plug-in. Jenkins CLI is a command line client for Jenkins.

The command to install plug-ins is quite simple and intuitive.

<code>java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 install-plugin testlink</code>
<h2>Additional hacks #1: Checking if the plug-in is already installed</h2>
I haven't had the chance to try JinFeng 0.2 yet, but I believe its install script will be able to use existing Jenkins or TestLink installations. So we need to check if TestLink plug-in is already installed, right?

Jenkins CLI has some built-in commands, like install-plugin. But it doesn't have a built-in command to check if a plug-in is already installed. So a workaround is to use the groovy command, that executes Groovy scripts in Jenkins (you may find convenient to use the groovysh command too, to execute your Groovy scripts, or http://localhost:8080/script for a web Groovy console).

Here is a sample script that checks if a plug-in is already installed or not.

[gist]<script src="https://gist.github.com/2008351.js"></script>[/gist]

Now you can execute this script as following: <code>cat ~/script1.groovy | java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080 groovy =</code> It will output 1 if Jenkins has the plug-in installed, or 0 otherwise.
<h2>What if I'm using a proxy?</h2>
That's doable as well. Here's another script for setting the proxy settings in Jenkins.

[gist]<script src="https://gist.github.com/2008358.js"> </script>[/gist]

You may be wondering how I'm creating these scripts. I'll blog about that later. But here's a quick explanation. I checked out Jenkins sources from GitHub, then imported the project in Eclipse. Then I create an empty class there, with a main method. Finally, I write what I would like to have in a Groovy script, but in Java. The last step is just convert it to Groovy, and voil√†!

Hope it helps other people too. If you use many scripts for administering Jenkins, you may be interested in Scriptler plug-in [5] too. They even have a scripts repository. Awesome, no? You can download the scripts mentioned in this post from there too. I simply love Jenkins community.

Cheers
