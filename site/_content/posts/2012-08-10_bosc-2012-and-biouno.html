 Few weeks ago <em>TupiLabs</em> participated of <em><a href="http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2012"
  title="BOSC 2012">BOSC 2012</a></em> , with a talk about <em><a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a></em>
 . BioUno is a project that applies techniques and tools from Continuous Integration in Bioinformatics, in special <em><a
  href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a></em> . In the very beginning, the project was a " <em>hey,
  look what I can do with Jenkins</em> ". Later on we defined that we would like to <em>create biology pipelines with
  Jenkins</em> , using plug-ins. This was the topic of our talk in BOSC 2012 - <strong>Creating biology pipelines
  with Jenkins</strong> . The main advantage of using Jenkins, is its <em>distributed environment with master and slaves</em> ,
 the <em>plug-ins</em> and the <em>documentation and community available</em> .

 In the talk, we showed a demo using vanilla Jenkins, <a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/" title="MrBayes">MrBayes</a>
 , with <a href="https://github.com/tupilabs/mrbayes-plugin" title="mrbayes-plugin">mrbayes-plugin</a> , and <a
  href="http://www.r-project.org/" title="R Project">R</a> and ape for plotting, using <a
  href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/r-plugin" title="r-plugin">r-plugin</a> . It was a very simple pipeline, without
 using Cloud services or any NGS tool. What was great in BOSC 2012 is that we could catch up with people that work on <a
  href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/" title="Galaxy">Galaxy</a> , <a href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/" title="Taverna">Taverna</a>
 , <a href="http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#welcome" title="Mobyle">Mobyle</a> and other workflow management
 systems, as well as lads from other interesting projects, like <a href="http://cloudgene.uibk.ac.at/" title="CloudGene">CloudGene</a>
 (MapReduce interface for researchers, pretty cool). When we returned to Brazil, we had more items to include in BioUno
 TODO list, but also a realization. That BioUno is not only a biology workflow management system. Its roles intersect
 with Galaxy, Taverna and Mobyle, as a <em>workflow management system</em> , but also intersect with <a
  href="http://biohpc.org/" title="BioHPC">BioHPC</a> , as a <em>bioinformatics computer management system</em> .

 With Jenkins you can start and monitor slaves remotely (in your local network or in a cloud), execute parts of your
 build in one machine and serialize results back to the master, display graphs, monitor usage and execute other things
 that give you the possibility to use Jenkins to <strong>create very customized pipelines</strong> . Sometimes a
 researcher has to use tools like <a href="http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/" title="stacks">stacks</a> , <a
  href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">samtools</a> , <a href="http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html"
  title="structure">structure</a> , <a href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page" title="Beast">beast</a> and so it
 goes. But sometimes he has need of a very specific routine, maybe for plotting something or adjusting data output from
 one tool, before inputting it into the next tool in the pipeline. <em>These routines are not always worth a tool,
  as they would be used very rarely</em> . This is possible with Jenkins. Or a job may demand five computers. Common computer
 facilities would delegate the machine provision to cluster management systems, like <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System" title="PBS">PBS</a> , <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF" title="LSF">LSF</a> or some <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="Cloud computing">cloud based system</a> . With Jenkins, you
 can manage your computer, maybe even use <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" title="Puppet">Puppet</a> to help you. We
 have a long way ahead, we are reorganizing our servers at <a
  href="http://www.linode.com/?r=6bd4d380e0421dab1a6ceb40ee0b6379da682de4" title="Linode">Linode</a> to install <a
  href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview" title="JIRA">JIRA</a> and <a
  href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview" title="Confluence">Confluence</a> , and have a more
 Jenkins-like web site (as this is the principal tool in BioUno). And we are still creating plug-ins. If you have any
 interested in the project, feel free to <a href="http://www.biouno.org/contact/" title="Contact BioUno">join us</a> ,
 your help will be very welcome :-)
