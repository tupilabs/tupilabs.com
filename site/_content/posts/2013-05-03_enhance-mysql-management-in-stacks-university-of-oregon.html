<p>Stacks processes RAD DNA sequences and produces output, that is displayed on the Web with a bundled PHP+MySQL
 application. This application is quite useful, especially since it helps developers to analyze large amounts of data.</p>

<p>One limitation though, is that some management tasks may need manual execution of SQL's in the database. Someone
 could add few scripts or new features to the Web interface (like a management section?). This could help researchers on
 their research.</p>
