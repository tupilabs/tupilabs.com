 <a href="http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com" title="Speak Like A Brazilian">Speak Like A Brazilian</a> started as a
 weekend project submitted to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a> and <a
  href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="Reddit">Reddit</a>. There was an amazing feedback and thus we decided to dedicate
 some time to a new version of SLBR. It is a web site to share Brazilian Portuguese expressions with other users.
 Anybody can submit expressions, like or dislike expressions and share the expressions with friends via e-mail or social
 networks.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>TL;DR</strong> We added the feature to have an expression with many definitions, simplified the design of the
 landing page and removed the need to register to submit expressions. Part of the work was based on user feedback, and
 another part was based on the way that <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban
  Dictionary</a> works.
</p>

<h2>What was done?</h2>

<p>We started by the database model. Initially, expressions were thought as a single entity. An expression had a
 text and its description. However, some users pointed that they could have more than one definition for the same
 expression. We had to break the table into two, expressions and definitions.</p>

<p>Time to rethink the landing page design. There are several articles that talk about the landing pages ([1], [2],
 [3]). Here are some basic guidelines that we followed when redesigning SLBR.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Limit action</li>
 <li>Buttons and call actions standing out</li>
 <li>Enable sharing</li>
</ul>

 <a href="{{site.base_url}}img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/old_1.png"><img src="{{site.base_url}}img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/old_1.png" alt=""
  title="Old version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-607" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Limit action</h3>

<p>The old version had too much text, a video and a box with tweets. As well as the letters menu. We removed this
 content, leaving only the letters menu, minus the Home and Login menu items. Now the user is presented with the search
 box, the letters menu and the top ten expressions.</p>

  title="New Version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-611" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Buttons and call actions standing out</h3>

<p>With less actions on the screen, the user experience will be better in SLBR. When the users sees the landing page
 now, there is the search button standing out, with a bigger font size. There is also a menu with letters with simple
 nagivation, and some expressions that give the users the picture of how the web site works.</p>

  title="New Version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-612" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Enable sharing</h3>

<p>This was a recommendation in one of the web sites mentioned earlier but UD already did that too. A very simple
 idea, and very easy to be put into practice too. We added a form that lets users share an expression via e-mail or via
 social networks. Hopefully it will increase the number of expressions in SLBR.</p>

  title="New Version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-613" /></a>
</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>We have also made several changes to the layout of items, and some CSS and JS enhancements, like using hover in
 some elements, modal windows to share and code to prevent a form being submitted twice.</p>

<p>But one of the greatest enhancements was allow users to submit expressions without having to log in. Before this,
 users were required to register in the web site in order to submit expression. That is just boring. After playing with
 UD, we decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>
 We will monitor the web site stats to check the results of this redesign, but so far we are very happy with this new
 version. The next step now is, probably, use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> to create a simple
 version of the web site for mobile users and promote the web site at local hostels.
