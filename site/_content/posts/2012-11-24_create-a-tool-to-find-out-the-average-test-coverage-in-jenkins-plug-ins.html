<p>
 This idea popped up while chatting with <a href="https://github.com/darkrift" title="https://github.com/darkrift">Richard
  Lavoie</a>. I was telling him about selenium tests for plug-ins, <a href="http://www.snakebite.org" title="SnakeBite">snakebite</a>
 one thing leads to another, and then came the idea of measuring the coverage in plug-ins.
</p>

<p>
 Basically, this tool would have to iterate over the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins"
  title="Jenkins Plugins">600+ plug-ins</a>, and trigger a
 <code>mvn test</code>
 command. Then it would have to save the coverage information somewhere, and plot a graph, or generate some report about
 it.

<p>Depending on the machine, probably this tool could spawn more than 1 thread for doing this. Even then, it would
 still take quite a while for processing all the plug-ins.</p>
