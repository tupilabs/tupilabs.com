The [Jenkins Workflow Plug-in](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin) will be presented next week during the 
[Jenkins User Conference 2014 in Boston](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston). In today's post I will 
document my findings while I learn about one of its Maven modules: cps.

The cps module provides [Continuation Passing Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style) 
(CPS) to the workflow-plugin. A CPS is similar to an [AST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) 
produced by compilers. 

// TODO: pic of an AST

// TODO: pic of an CPS tree? Maybe the same block of code
