<p>We are preparing a new release of <a href="http://www.tap4j.org" title="tap4j">tap4j</a> in the upcoming days. It's been a while since last release, and it is one of our favorite Java projects. tap4j is a complete implementation of the <a href="http://www.testanything.org" title="Test Anything Protocol">Test Anything Protocol</a> (TAP) for Java. This test protocol has been created with <a href="http://www.perl.org" title="Perl">Perl</a> 1, about 1988, and can be extended with <a href="http://www.yaml.org" title="YAML">YAML</a>.</p>

<p>This release will include only code enhancements, like javadoc, TODO/TBD/FIXME tags and code styles improvements. The repository has been migrated from under kinow unto <a href="https://github.com/tupilabs/tap4j" title="TupiLabs at GitHub">tupilabs at GitHub</a>. The issue tracking from SourceForge.net has been replaced by <a href="https://www.github.com/tupilabs/tap4j/issues" title="tap4j issues at GitHub">GitHub</a>, as it is easier to manage Pull Requests and issues at the same place. And we also replaced CloudBees Open Source tap4j project by <a href="http://buildhive.cloudbees.com" title="CloudBees BuildHive">CloudBees BuildHive</a>, as it also has a nice integration with GitHub.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, a new release is coming :D</p>
