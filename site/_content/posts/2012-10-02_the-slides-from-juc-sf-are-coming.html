Watch the news for more upcoming slides from JUC SF (Jenkins User Conference San Francisco). You can already check <a href="http://www.kohsuke.org" title="Kohsuke Kawaguchi">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>'s slides. The link is for the <a href="http://www.reddit.com" title="Reddit, take this poor man's soul">reddit</a> thread, so you can comment there and give karma to @agentdero who posted the link.

Another interesting news is that now CloudBees Jenkins can deploy to GoogleAppEngine. I believe that in the near future BuildHive will have integration with other platforms and will be able to build software written in many programming languages too.
