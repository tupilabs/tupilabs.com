            <description><p>Hi there!</p>

<p>In this blog post we will show how we make our vector illustrations. The whole process of drawing, scanning and adjusting the image levels is quite simple. The level adjustment step is required only if you think that the image is not legible enough. In some cases, you may prefer just using an eraser to remove some extra lines, shadows or stains.</p>

            <description><p>In the <a href="creating-a-pbsmpi-cluster-for-bioinformatics-part-1/" title="Creating a PBS/MPI cluster for bioinformatics – Part 1">previous post</a> of this series we saw how to configure a basic network for our small cluster. Now it is time to work on the <strong>MPI</strong> stuff. Our cluster will be a <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_cluster" title="Beowulf Cluster Wiki entry">Beowulf cluster</a></strong>. This kind of cluster is composed of <strong>commodity computers</strong>, connected via network sharing resources and programs. And in the next post, we will see how to include a <em>batch queuing system</em> to control the resource utilization in our cluster.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface" title="Message Passing Interface Wiki entry">MPI</a> is not a library. MPI is actually a standard. When you find an RESTful application, REST is only a standard, and you have different libraries that implement this standard (Jersey, JBoss Reast Easy, CodeIgniter+Rest Controllers, and so it goes). With MPI it is not different. There are different implementations of the MPI specification. We suggest you to read <a href="http://techtinkering.com/2009/12/02/setting-up-a-beowulf-cluster-using-open-mpi-on-linux/" title="Setting Up a Beowulf Cluster using OpenMPI on Linux">this tutorial</a> that, although it was written in 2009, it uses Debian (operational system we are using in BioUno cluster) and is very well written and concise. Basically, you have to install <a href="http://open-mpi.org/" title="OpenMPI">OpenMPI</a>, one of the existing MPI libraries. And if you followed the instructions in <a href="creating-a-pbsmpi-cluster-for-bioinformatics-part-1/" title="Creating a PBS/MPI cluster for bioinformatics – Part 1">part 1</a> of this series, then you already have SSH correctly configured in your computers.</p>

            <description><p>This is a series of posts with the steps we are using to set up an internal cluster for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics" title="Bioinformatics Wikipedia entry">bioinformatics</a> using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface" title="Message Passing Interface">MPI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System" title="Portable Batch System">PBS</a> for distributed jobs. Our goal with this series is help other nerds setting up similar environment. This cluster is not public yet, and we are using for development of <a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a>. At moment we are writing code to integrate our <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a> with <a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/" title="MrBayes">MrBayes</a> and <a href="http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html" title="Structure">Structure</a>.</p>

<p>In this first post, we will see how to configure the network for each machine be able to see the other one, and how to configure SSH for connecting to the other nodes in the cluster. If you already know MrBayes and Structure, skip the Introduction and go to the <a href="#basic-network-configuration">basic network configuration topic</a>. We assume you have a intermediary knowledge of Linux, as many instructions in this series are vague. We always reference the original tutorial that we used. This series may be edited to stay up to date or for improvements.</p>

            <description><p>If you are using <a title="GMapEz" href="http://n01se.net/gmapez/">GMapEz</a> and you load it dynamically, then you may face a problem having a gray area instead of your map. In our case, we were using GMapEz and <a title="JQuery Stepy" href="http://www.wbotelhos.com/stepy/">JQuery Stepy</a>. When the page was loaded, the first step didn&#8217;t have a map. When the user hit next, then a map was supposed to appear, but it was gray.</p>
<p>What happens is that if the map is not displayed then you will have to call &#8216;checkResize&#8217; on GMapEz&#8217; map object.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is expose the googlemap as a variable accessible from other scripts. For this, you will need to edit gmapez-x.js, including &#8216;var googlemap = null;&#8217; in the top of your script, and then modify the source as needed to create the object.</p>
<p>Finally, when the map is displayed (in our case, on step number 2 of the form) you call googlemap.map.checkResize().</p>
<p>This should fix your gray map :-)</p>

            <description><p>It&#8217;s a bit short notice, but we will be holding our first slack line session tomorrow morning at <a title="Parque Villa Lobos" href="http://www.ambiente.sp.gov.br/parquevillalobos/">Villa Lobos park</a>! Should you are around there, look for us, hop on the rope and let&#8217;s have some fun. While we are on the ground we can talk about geek things too :-)</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
<hr />
<p>Yeah!  We made it!</p>
<p>Thank&#8217;s to Bruno, Claudinha, Brian, Cibele, Luciana and our new fellows from DiBrasil Slackline.</p>
<p>It was a perfect day.

            <description><p>What ho lads!</p>
<p>Few days ago I was talking with Olivier Renault [1] about few things that he needs to deploy JinFeng [1] using a non-interactive command line. JinFeng is an integration and testing platform built on top of many Open Source tools, like TestLink [2] and Jenkins [3]. One of the features he needs is Test Steps in TestLink XML-RPC API (I&#8217;m working on this, and hopefully will be able to provide a patch for TestLink 1.9.4).

 Tell me about writing a specific title. This is my first entry here in TupiLabs. Today I will show you how to configure
 <a title="Jenkins" href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> Git Plug-in, to retrieve sources from a private
 repository hosted at <a title="BitBucket" href="http://www.bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>. Phew. Ah, and all this using a
 Windows server.
</p>

<p>
 <strong><a href="#tldr">TL;DR</a></strong>: ssh -vT &lt;host&gt; displays where it is looking for your .ssh directory.
 Probably you will want check permissions and the %HOME% environment variable too. In case your job is getting stuck,
 click here to skip the introduction text.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<ul>
 <li>At TupiLabs, we have repositories hosted at <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com">GitHub </a>(public
  repositories) and BitBucket (mix of public and private repositories).
 </li>
 <li>We use Jenkins for many activities. Not only as a build server, but as a <em>function</em> in our development
  environment. We will talk about that later ;-)
 </li>
 <li>We use Jenkins, Mac and Windows for development.</li>
 <li>We have jobs running at <a title="Linode"
  href="http://www.linode.com/?r=6bd4d380e0421dab1a6ceb40ee0b6379da682de4">Linode</a> with <a title="Ubuntu"
  href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>+Jenkins+Git Plug-in+BitBucket.
 </li>
 <li>There aren&#8217;t many resources for configuring Jenkins and BitBucket in Windows.</li>
 <li>I have a good friend of mine who would like to read about it. Heck! That&#8217;s enough to write about it :-D</li>
</ul>
