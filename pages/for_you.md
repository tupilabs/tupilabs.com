                <h1>TupiLabs was created for you!</h1>

                <p>Our services and solutions are created thinking about you. We use English, even though
                it is not the native English of every member in TupiLabs, but we believe this way we are including
                more people.</p>

                <p>Our software is created with permissive Open Source OSI approved licenses, so that
                you can use it for both your hobby and professional project. And we contribute to both new and existing
                open source projects.</p>

                <p>We have no preference for programming language or operating system. We like Jenkins CI,
                but we will try to work and fix issues in Travis CI or TeamCity.</p>

                <p>If you believe in our work, and would like to contribute so that we can continue working for you,
                you can donate:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Money</li>
                    <li>Software License</li>
                    <li>Servers for our projects</li>
                    <li>Time, working with us in OSS projects</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Or just let us know. We appreciate any feedback.</p>

                <p>Happy hacking!</p>
