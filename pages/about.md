                <h1>About</h1>

                <p><strong>Open Source</strong> and <strong>Innovation</strong> are the core of TupiLabs. We craft code for Open Source projects, as well as create new Open Source projects. Our contributions can be found in several Open Source projects, as well as some work done via consultancy for enterprise solutions.</p>

                <p>If you have an idea and need help to contribute to an Open Source project, or if you are adopting an Open Source project or technology in your company, feel free to drop us a message. We may be able to help you. We can work together to create a new project, or develop the solution for you. In both cases, there are cases where we may be interested in working on the project, and there will be no costs :-)</p>

                <h1>History</h1>

                <p>In 2010 <a href="https://github.com/cesar1983">Cesar Fernandes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kinow">Bruno P. Kinoshita</a> were working together as contractors for an IT consultancy, allocated with a telecom client in Sao Paulo. The work was to write Java code to automate tasks for testing and QA in the company CRM, and for that we used a lot of Open Source tools (e.g. TestLink, Java, Jenkins).</p>

                <p>When they went surfing in the North Coast of Sao Paulo, or went to the gym for climbing or slack lining, they talked about how they did not have enough time to contribute to Open Source, or to properly write software following good practices and with good quality. They started to have ideas for side projects that they could work together and that was when the idea of creating a company started.</p>

                <p>Both time and money were invested on the company, and eventually TupiLabs got its first prospect clients in Sao Paulo. However, the business model &mdash; mainly tailored to support Open Source projects &mdash; didn't work very well.</p>

                <p>In 2014&mdash;2015 TupiLabs got a big contract to help a finance company in Sao Paulo to implement an enterprise Big Data strategy. Code and documentation for the Open Source projects used could be contributed back to the projects, and there was time to choose the right tools for the job and implement a solid foundation for the company's Big Data strategy.</p>

                <p>In 2015 Bruno was leaving Brazil to live in New Zealand and Cesar had became the co-owner of a Hostel in Sao Paulo. That was TupiLabs' last contract in Brazil, and the amount of time spent on TupiLabs had to be reduced. Now TupiLabs is mainly a repository for Open Source projects, with some ideas and products being created. Not a self-sustainable business, but we are still kicking and contributing to Open Source projects.</p>

                <p>The projects and products developed by TupiLabs will continue to be supported. We have started 2016 with a new website, where we will also start to provide online courses, and eventually in the next months will implement more of our ideas, creating new libraries and products, as well as contributing to Open Source projects.</p>

                <p>We trust you will find some interesting content in our <a href="">Blog</a>, as well as in our <a href="">Tutorial</a> section. Take a look at our <a href="">Work</a> page to learn more about what is being created by us. Finally, every week we publish an open report on everything that happened in TupiLabs. Many of the items in these reports are contributions to Open Source projects.</p>

                <p>Have fun and happy hacking!</p>
