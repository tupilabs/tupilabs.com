My favorite SQL Editor is [Aqua Datastudio](http://www.aquafold.com/), which I use for Open Source projects, accessing Hive, MySQL, SQLite and several other data bases. However, while working on a customer site, I can't use Datastudio due to its license. So another great SQL Editor that I use is [Squirrel SQL](http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net/).

Last week I had to execute several queries manually against a SPARQL endpoint - that was using [Fuseki](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/serving_data/) BTW. After doing that for ten minutes I decided that I needed a more productive way. Here's where [Jena JDBC](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/jdbc/) enters.

## Preparing your environment

In order to query a SPARQL endpoint, the first thing you need is a SPARQL endpoint. For this experiment, let's use the [myExperiment public SPARQL endpoint](http://rdf.myexperiment.org/sparql). myExperiment is used for sharing workflows, and I've been studying it to use in [BioUno](http://biouno.org).

We will also need a SPARQL query. Let's use the following simple and intuitive query, limiting to 10 results.

{% geshi 'sql' %}
SELECT *
	WHERE {
		?s ?p ?o
} 
LIMIT 10
{% endgeshi %}

You will also need to download:

- [Squirrel SQL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/squirrel-sql/files/)
- [Jena JDBC](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.apache.jena%22%20AND%20a%3A%22jena-jdbc-driver-bundle%22)

## Configuring Squirrel SQL

You probably already have Squirrel SQL installed at this point. If not, download the jar and run <code>java -jar squirrel\*.jar</code>. And you may have been tempted to check all the plug-ins during the installation. The problem is that the SQL Parametrisation plug-in will think that the *?s ?p ?o* are variables, and will keep popping a dialog for you to input values. 

So **disable the SQL Parametrisation plug-in** by going to Plugins / Summary and unchecking it.

Copy the Jena JDBC bundle jar to $SQUIRREL_HOME/lib/, and go to the Drivers tab, probably on your left, and add a JDBC driver for Jena JDBC. Give it any name you like. As example URL you can use *jdbc:jena:remote:query=http://localhost:3030/ds/query&update=http://localhost:3030/ds/update*. And the class name, for remote endpoints, is **org.apache.jena.jdbc.remote.RemoteEndpointDriver**.

Finally, add a new connection, by going to the Aliases tab - again, probably on your left - and selecting the Jena driver that you just created. Give it some cool name, select the Jena driver, and for the connection URL use *jdbc:jena:remote:query=http://rdf.myexperiment.org/sparql*. Save it and you are ready to rock.

<img src="{{assets.jenajdbc02}}" alt="Jena JDBC" />
</a>

</figure>
</div>

## Your first SPARQL query using JDBC

By double clicking the connection alias and confirming that you want to connect (leave user and pass empty) Squirrel SQL should give a screen where you can enter SQL commands. Enter any SPARQL query and give it a shot. Here's my result.

Happy hacking!
