Here's the list of the cool things that happened at **TupiLabs** since last Sunday.

- Still working on new version of [Speak Like A Brazilian](http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com) and preparing to Open Source its code.
- Finished rewriting parts of **[Cafe Hostel](http://cafehostel.com.br)** to include more tests and reduce duplicities. Now preparing a new deploy.
- Fixed a [Jenkins TAP Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TAP+Plugin) issue reported via e-mail
- Merged [https://github.com/jenkinsci/testlink-plugin/pull/8](https://github.com/jenkinsci/testlink-plugin/pull/8) for the [Jenkins TestLink Plug-in], thanks to [@maBergaoui](https://github.com/maBergaoui) now the plug-in has a better support to platforms.
- [Jenkins TestLink Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/TestLink+Plugin) 3.7 released!
- [https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19509](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-19509)
- [https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-18916](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-18916)
- [r/functionalprogramming](http://reddit.com/r/functionalprogramming) has over 440 subscribers! \o/ Yay!
- A paper by a Tupi has been accepted to the [MiniPLoP 2013](http://cbsoft2013.unb.br/miniplop)
- Merged the [generators-FUNCTOR-14 branch](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/commons/proper/functor/branches/generators-FUNCTOR-14/?pathrev=1373984), and after a few more tests the issue [FUNCTOR-14](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FUNCTOR-14) probably can be marked as resolved.

We are working [for you]({{site.base_url}}for_you/)

Have a great week! :-)
