<p><a href="http://www.homolog.us/">Homolog.us</a> is an amazing site. The content is clear, rich and very entertaining (at least for those who like biology and technology). They have an active <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/homolog_us/">Twitter account</a>, they answer comments, they are on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/bioinformatics">reddit</a> too. <strong>These guys rock</strong>!</p>

<p>Recently <a href="http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/02/05/pacbiotoca-for-error-correcting-pacbio-reads/">they wrote</a> about <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/wgs-assembler/index.php?title=PacBioToCA">PacBioToCA</a>, pointing out its lengthy execution. It's common in biotechnology parallel execution with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_MPI" title="">OpenMPI</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP">OpenMP</a> or other method like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a>.</p>

<p>One idea would be review the code, check if it's doable some kind of parallelism and write about it. Perhaps rewriting it. They <a href="http://www.homolog.us/blogs/2013/02/05/lsc-an-alternative-to-pacbiotoca-for-error-correction-of-pacbio-reads/">already wrote</a> about another tool that competes with PacBioToCA. I told you that Homolog.us is amazing.</p>
