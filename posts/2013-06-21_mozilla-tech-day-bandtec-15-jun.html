Last weekend we attended [**Mozilla Tech Day**](https://reps.mozilla.org/e/mozilla-tech-day-bandtec/) 
at [BandTec](http://www.bandtec.com.br/index.php/vida-no-campus/mozilla-tech-day/) Faculty. 
BandTec is the technology faculty of BandTec college. It is located near Paraiso 
metro station, what is very convenient in Sao Paulo city.

Arriving at BandTec was easy, and there were many families going to the college, 
for weekend activities with their kids. After the entrance stairs there was a 
reception desk with BandTec students. They were distributing tags with 
the room number and talk title. You had to choose one talk for the whole day. 
You could change that, but you would have to go downstairs :-(

The interior of the building looks a lot like the buildings at 
[Mackenzie University](http://www.mackenzie.br), with 
red bricks and large windows. We could watch only one talk, 
["HTML5 and CSS3"](http://www.bandtec.com.br/index.php/vida-no-campus/mozilla-tech-day/) 
with [Ricardo Panaggio](https://twitter.com/panaggio), due to Brazil opening 
match against Japan, for the Confederations Cup.

Panaggio gave an amazing talk. It was very dynamic and simple. Sometimes speaking 
about basic stuff like browsers, standards, what is HTML and CSS; to more advanced 
topics like technical parts of standards, how these standards are defined, 
different ways to use HTML5 tags, and so on. There were *nerds* of different ages, so 
probably everybody enjoyed Panaggio's talk.

His talk lasted from 8AM till ~12AM, when he finished separating the class in groups 
for the **afternoon hack activity**, where each group would work on a subject of the 
talk. *Devices* and *geolocation* were hot topics and had the largest groups (there were 
something *about 30 people* in the room).

We enjoyed learning more about [FirefoxOS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/) 
(another speaker had brought phones with FirefoxOS, but we couldn't see it), standards, 
HTML5 and CSS3. BandTec provided great infrastructure for this event, and Mozilla had 
all speakers identified with its Orange T-Shirt. We couldn't get a sticker from 
Mozilla, but hopefully next Mozilla Tech Day we'll have another chance. 

Thanks [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org)!
