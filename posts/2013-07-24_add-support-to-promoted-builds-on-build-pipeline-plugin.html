From [https://code.google.com/p/build-pipeline-plugin/issues/detail?id=80](https://code.google.com/p/build-pipeline-plugin/issues/detail?id=80)

Jenkins [Build Pipeline Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin), 
by [Centrum Systems](http://www.centrumsystems.com.au/) (Australia), is an excellent 
plug-in, used by many users (over 6000 downloads according to 
[last report](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin)).

However, it does not work well with the [Jenkins Promoted Builds Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Promoted+Builds+Plugin), 
another great plug-in (over 4100 downloads [last month](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Promoted+Builds+Plugin)).

It means that *users are not able to create pipelines based on promotion* (promoted pipelines?). 
This contribution would be awesome, **useful** and help a lot of users (maybe over 10000? :-)
