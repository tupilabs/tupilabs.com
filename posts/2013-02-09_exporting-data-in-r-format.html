 <a href="www.quandl.com">Quandl</a> has now a feature that lets users export data as an R matrix, this way the data can
 be easily <a href="http://www.quandl.com/help/r">loaded into R</a>. Damn awesome righto? Kudos to the guys from Quandl!
</p>

 <code>read.csv('http://www.quandl.com/api/v1/datasets/OFDP/ALUMINIUM_21.csv?&utf8=â&trim_start=2012-01-03&trim_end=2013-02-07&sort_order=desc',
  colClasses=c('Date'='Date'))</code>

<p>Today's idea is use Quandl approach in other applications. Jenkins exports some of its objects to its external
 JSON API. And there are stats being collected from plug-ins (like the download statistics). I am curious to know if
 there would have any gain in exporting parts of this data as R matrices and processing it directly with R.</p>

<p>This could be used in a lot of different applications, perhaps even using Hadoop and R. Instead of writing
 collectors to consume an RESTful service, you would simply write one R line to get the job done.</p>

<p>R does very fine in plotting too, so I wouldn't be surprised to at least see some prettier charts :o)</p>
