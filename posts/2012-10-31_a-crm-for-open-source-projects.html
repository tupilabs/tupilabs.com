 The idea is basically to create a simple CRM for Open Source projects. As there's a great diversity of Open Source
 tools, and depending on its nature (low level API, build server, office suite) the development team may need different
 features, the ideal is that it has some kind of <strong>plug-in API</strong>, or <strong>modules</strong>.

 It could help organizing donors, events, meetings, file exchange, among other things. And it would be useful if it was
 a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" title="SaaS definition at Wikipedia">SaaS</a> (and
 cheap/free!).

 The idea came after a tweet by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/agentdero" title='@agentdero'>@agentdero</a>.
