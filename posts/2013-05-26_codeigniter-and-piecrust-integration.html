In of our largest web applications is [Speak Like A Brazilian](http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com). 
We've been working to Open Source it, but first we have to double check the security 
aspects of this procedure, as well as review the source code.

Recently we added a blog to Speak Like A Brazilian. Navigating in the Internet, we 
found many tutorials for adding a blog engine to web applications using 
[CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter).

Since the blog is limited to moderators or developers, we decided to use a 
static content generator, preferably one that supported *Markdown*. 
We opted for [PieCrust](http://www.bolt80.com/piecrust), and after few tests we were delighted by the 
flexibility and modularity.

## Adding PieCrust to a CodeIgniter project

We will assume you have some basic knowledge on CodeIgniter and *PHP* (the latter 
being less required for this post). If not, you can learn more about it on its website.

Download CodeIgniter and unzip it (or import into your IDE workspace). Now 
download PieCrust. Unzip it to *$CI_HOME/tools/piecrust* (the tools directory is 
also used by other tools, like *[Sparks](http://getsparks.org/))*.

Copy the contents of *$CI_HOME/tools/piecrust/website/* to 
*$CI_HOME/application/blog/*. This is where you'll put your blog contents, 
including posts, pages, [macros]({{pcurl('/2013/05/26/creating-a-twig-macro-for-piecrust')}}) and templates.

In *#CI_HOME/application/blog/_content/*, you'll find the config.yml YAML file. This file contains your blog 
configuration and is read by PieCrust when it bakes (compiles your website into HTML) and when it servers your 
blog (using a bundled HTTP server).

Change the contents of this file to look like the following: 

{% geshi 'yaml' %}
site:
    title: Your New PieCrust Website
    description: A sample website running with PieCrust
    author: Anonymous
    pretty_urls: false
    
smartypants:
    enable: true

server:
    config_variants:
        default:
            site:
                base_url: http://localhost/codeigniter-piecrust-integration/

baker:
    skip_patterns:
        - /^index.php/
    config_variants:
        default:
            site:
                base_url: http://localhost/codeigniter-piecrust-integration/
        production:
            site:
                base_url: http://www.mywebsite.com/{%endgeshi%}

The *server* entry is used when serving your blog, and the *baker* entry is used for compiling your pages into HTML. 
By adding the base URL, you can add links to CodeIgniter pages from your blog. The next steps for your integration 
will be prepare a build script to serve/bake your blog, and customize the template.

In Speak Like A Brazilian, we've created a similar template for our PieCrust blog, so that the user won't notice he 
is accessing a different application. You will notice in the screen shots that we have modified the default templates 
in CodeIgniter and PieCrust to include a link to each other, so you'll get the idea of how to use the site and blog 
URL's in your menus, pages, templates, etc.

## Summary

This approach may not be the best choice if you are developing a web site for a client, say, a photographer, that is 
not used to git or Markdown. But for personal web sites, or other geek related web sites, it can be very hand. 
Especially since by using PieCrust you can drop *WordPress* and *MySQL*, saving some memory in your web server.

We have put up a simple application, with the integration described in this post in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/tupilabs/codeigniter-piecrust-integration). 
There is a simple Ant build.xml file, that may be helpful for you when cooking/baking your site. We also have a 
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) instance monitoring Speak Like A Brazilian git repository, and publishing a new 
version of the web site for each new commit to the master.

Have fun :-)
