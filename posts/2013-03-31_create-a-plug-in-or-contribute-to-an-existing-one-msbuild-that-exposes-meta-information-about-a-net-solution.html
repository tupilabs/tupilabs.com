<p>This idea happened after <a href="http://www.twitter.com/agrayz" title="@agrayz">Andrew Gray'</a>s <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/objectified-solutions/" title="Objectified Solutions">objectified-solutions</a>. With Objectified Solutions one can extract meta information from a .NET solution. This information includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Global properties of the solution</li>
	<li>List of projects in solution</li>
	<li>Global properties of each project</li>
	<li>List of source files in each project</li>
	<li>List of System references that each project depends on</li>
	<li>List of Project references that each project depends on</li>
	<li>Basic properties of each source file</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/agray/objectified-solutions" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> too. Maybe someone could even think about a ".NET solution project" job type for Jenkins.</p>
