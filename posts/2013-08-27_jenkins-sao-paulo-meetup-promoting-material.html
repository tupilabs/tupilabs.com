Sao Paulo is going to host the Jenkins Meetup 2013. It is the second 
time the event occurs, and we bet this year's event will be even more 
awesome!

You can help the event by promoting it within your organization, with your 
friends, family and co-workers. Feel free to use the following banners to help 
spreading the word about the event.

The event is free but if you are going to attend it, please answer 
the [meetup RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/133598002/). 
The **[Call for papers](http://www.cloudbees.com/forms/jenkins-user-conference-call-papers.cb)** 
is open too, send your case, tutorial, lighting talk or other suggestions.

Furthermore, let us know if you are interested in sponsoring the event. 
We have compiled a [sponsorship program (PDF)]({{site.base_url}}public_files/sponsor_jenkins.pdf).
