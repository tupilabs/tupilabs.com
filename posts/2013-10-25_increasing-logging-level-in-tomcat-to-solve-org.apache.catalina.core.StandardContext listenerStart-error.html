Sometimes during the deployment of new applications in [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org) 
you may see errors like 'org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext listenerStart' in your 
startup log.

This may be caused due to many reasons (missing classes, including javax.servlet.* jars with 
your application, etc), but the reason is not displayed in the startup log.

But you can find out what is causing this error by adding **logging.properties** to your 
$TOMCAT_HOME/conf directory, with the following content:

    org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].level = DEBUG
    org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[Catalina].handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
    
After that you should be able to see the whole exception and figure out what is 
causing your application to fail.

Happy hacking!
