<p>Yesterday a new version of <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Testopia+Plugin" title="Jenkins Testopia Plug-in">Jenkins Testopia Plug-in</a> was released. This version includes code to avoid printing null when a value returned from Testopia is null. Instead, it now prints an empty String (i.e.: "").</p>

<p>It has been included i18n support too, with English, Brazilian Portuguese and Dutch (thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/peterflorijn" title="Peter Florijn">Peter Florijn</a>) languages. If you use Testopia Plug-in and would like to contribute translating the plug-in, send a <a href="https://www.github.com/jenkinsci/testopia-plugin" title="Jenkins Testopia Plug-in">pull request</a>.</p>
