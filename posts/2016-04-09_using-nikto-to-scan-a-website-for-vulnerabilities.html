[Nikto](https://www.cirt.net/Nikto2) is a web server scanner, written in Perl and licensed under
GNU GPL. The [source code](https://github.com/sullo/nikto.git) is available at GitHub.

We released a new version of [Speak Like A Brazilian](https://speaklikeabrazilian.com) last week,
upgrading from Laravel 4.x to 5.x. Once we had a release candidate (RC) tag
ready we deployed it and ran Nikto to check for issues in the server.

The default settings are enough for an initial test, but you can take a look at
*nikto --help* for other interesting parameters.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
nikto -host https://speaklikeabrazilian.com
{% endgeshi %}

Here are the results of the scanning.

{% geshi 'shell' %}

{% endgeshi %}

There list had a few false positives, but two outstanding issues could be easily fixed.
First the .htaccess file.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
# File: speaklikeabrazilian.vhost.conf
# From: https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/recipes/dokuwiki/
# Block access to .htaccess files
location ~ /\.ht {
    deny  all;
}
{% endgeshi %}

And the second one is to hide the PHP server signature.

{% geshi 'shell' %}
# File: php.ini
# From: http://www.techbrown.com/hide-server-signature-of-nginx-php-version-on-linux.shtml
expose_php = Off
{% endgeshi %}

It is not polite to run Nikto (or most other scanners to be honest) on web sites that you
do not maintain. Some sites are behind firewalls and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) systems
that may block Nikto. When that happens, you can liaise with your Ops team and schedule an
internal run on an application you develop or maintain.

Nikto may help you finding flaws in your server and deployment. The next step now for Speak Like A
Brazilian now is running the new code through
[OWASP's ZAP Proxy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project),
which can analyse the HTTP requests for possible bugs.

Happy hacking!
