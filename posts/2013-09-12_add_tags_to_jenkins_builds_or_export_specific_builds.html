This idea is from [@abayer](http://twitter.com/abayer), from these following tweets:

We could simply add tags to builds, and then create some place that would list 
the builds (or other things) that are tagged appropriately. Or we could add a way 
to define whicih builds should be exported to some tool, and then via the plug-in 
API maybe, post to this external tool.
