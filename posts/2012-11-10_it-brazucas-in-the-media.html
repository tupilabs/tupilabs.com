 As an avid reader of reddit, Hacker News, Slashdot and other geek web sites, I've been surprised by the number of IT <a
  href="http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com/expression/define?e=Brazuca" title="Brazuca">Brazucas</a> that have written
 articles that appeared on the top of these news websites lately.
</p>

<p>Here are two that I saw last week.</p>

<ul>
 <li>APIMiner - Documenting APIs with source code examples - featured <a href="http://reddit.com/r/java"
  title="r/java">r/java</a> top page (<a href="http://java.llp2.dcc.ufmg.br/apiminer/howit.html"

 </li>
 <li>Learn a Programming Language Faster by Copying Unix - featured <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com"

 Microsoft also announced about a new IT center in Rio de Janeiro. Microsoft has already invested some millions in Sao
 Paulo, but looks like they are building something even bigger in Rio now - <a
