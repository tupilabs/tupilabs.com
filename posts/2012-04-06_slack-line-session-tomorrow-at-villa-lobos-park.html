It's a bit short notice, but we will be holding our first slack line session tomorrow morning at <a title="Parque Villa Lobos" href="http://www.ambiente.sp.gov.br/parquevillalobos/">Villa Lobos park</a>! Should you are around there, look for us, hop on the rope and let's have some fun. While we are on the ground we can talk about geek things too :-)

See you there!

Yeah!Â  We made it!

Thank's to Bruno, Claudinha, Brian, Cibele, Luciana and our new fellows from DiBrasil Slackline.

It was a perfect day.
