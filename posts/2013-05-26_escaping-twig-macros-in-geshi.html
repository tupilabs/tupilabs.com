While writing the [last post]({{pcurl('/2013/05/26/creating-a-twig-macro-for-piecrust')}}), I had some trouble trying to escape a Twig macro 
when using Geshi for syntax highlighting. Here's the trick to escape it: 
*[raw](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/tags/raw.html)*.

The *raw* Twig tag prints the subsequent tags without interpreting it.

{%geshi 'twig'%}
{%raw%}{%geshi 'twig'%}
{ %raw%}{% macro button(...) %}{ %endraw%}
<p>Some random HTML code...</p>{% raw%}{% endmacro %}{ %endraw%}
{%endgeshi%}{%endraw%}{%endgeshi%}

*We had to add an extra space between { and %. Can you figure out why? :-)*
