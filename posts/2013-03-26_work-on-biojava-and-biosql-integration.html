<p><a href="http://www.biojava.org" title="BioJava">BioJava</a> code has two versions, the current one (version 3) and the legacy code. In one of these month's messages to the <a href="http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biojava-dev/2013-March/005114.html">BioJava development mailing list</a>: </p>

<blockquote>"Unfortunately, biojava 3 does not have any support for biosql at this
stage. If you want to use that, you will have to use the biojava 1.x
series..."</blockquote>

<p>BioJava is extremely useful for Java projects, researchers, libraries and tools. And the same can be said about as <a href="http://www.biosql.org">BioSQL</a>. The integration of these two tools would bring many benefits to the whole community (private companies, researchers, institutions, universities, etc).</p>
