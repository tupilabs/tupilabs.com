On Wednesday the **[DMC Latam 2013](http://www.dmc-latam.com)** chapter Brazil took place
in Braston Hotel. The hotel is located on *[Augusta Street](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g303631-d2703936-Reviews-Rua_Augusta-Sao_Paulo_State_of_Sao_Paulo.html)*, in
downtown. Augusta used to be a bohemian area, but it is
near Roosevelt Square, Consolacao Church and other touristic
points now.

Being a programmer, after I arrived at DMC Latam, I was astonished by the number of people
wearing suits - and I wearing an ol' T-shirt. Many participants were foreigners, but there were also many
Brazilian executive, managers and a few programmers.

The first talk of the day was by **Sue Geuens**, *DAMA International*
operational director, from South Africa. She talked about
data management, her experiences and difficulties working
in the CDO team. I had no idea there were so many
committees and meeting to discuss data management in a big corporation:-)
I loved her closing sentence: *"Make data governance. fun. By making it fun, you will make people want to work with you"*.

**Lola de Oliveira** was the second speaker, with the
talk *"Eficiencia no tratamento e utilizacao de informacoes"*.
Lola works at *Boa Vista*, a local credit bureau. Any Brazilian knows that if they do not
pay his bills, his name can "get dirty" ([ficar sujo](http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com/search?q=Nome+sujo)). The vast amount of data that Boa Vista handles every day,
and its processes and types of services are very interesting.

The talk was more about the process, how to find the right
data and avoid inserting false information into the database.
 But what is really interesting, is that while other speakers complained about difficulties in getting business understanding the importance of data within a company, one of the most valuable assets of Boa Vista, is data. So the opposite is true, and the company is based on data acquisition and treatment.

After a coffee break, time to listen to *ASG's* **Ian Rowlands**, on supporting
data governance. And I was delighted to listen during his personal
presentation, that he is a programmer - everybody knows nobody stops being a programmer :-) -, and that he started with Assembly.

I learned a new meaning for KDE (yup, not the [window manager]()):
**key data elements**. And, the most important, I learned a lot
about **metadata** and a little more about data governance.
 His talk was on of the funniest and more instructive in the event.

Last talk before lunch. **Oscar Asakura** and **Sheila Aniceto** showed us a
success case at *BMF Bovespa*. Oscar gave a brief explanation on *EBITDA* and
why is that important for a company. In the sequence Sheila explained more about BMF Bovespa. BMF Bovespa (or Bovespa
as it is also known) is the Brazilian stock exchange, located
at Sao Paulo.

The problem with good food, is that you usually get sleepy after eating it.
But there was another good talk, by **Dormevilly Tertius** and a professional from *CCEE*. Unfortunately I couldn't get her name, and it wasn't listed in the speakers sheet. I think CCEE changed the speaker. They both gave a general overview on how CCEE applied data governance and what tools they used.
 Probably CCEE has a lot of data to handle, since all the data about energy sold in Brazil passes by its computers.

**Gustavo Leal**, from *Localiza Rent a Car*, not only explained data quality,
but also brought some monitoring graphs that are used at Localiza â€“ some reminded me of the graphs plotted with [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com). This was
one of my favorite talks. Gustavo didn't enter into technical details, but gave told us a little of what kinds of technologies (*JMS*, *ESB*, *Canonical Models*,
among others) they were using at Localiza.

He also didn't enter into details about the data governance, but
gave examples and tried to explain some of the scenarios they
had. I believe I understood more about data quality and how it
fits into data governance, as well as the importance of IT for data management.

*Big Data!* I hadn't heard anything about Big Data till **Alexis Zlocowski** talk. He had another co-worker with him, but his name wasn't listed in the program. They both talked about *Hadoop* and its history (Google, Yahoo!),
but also pointed the importance of assessing the necessity of a Hadoop
project for Big Data. This was one of the talks with the most
questions for the speakers.

What I really liked, was that they gave special emphasis on the necessity to think well, before simply buying software, or blindly adopting technologies in the company.

Last talk, **Kewal Dhariwal**. Not only talking about data, but also
gave a good lecture on culture differences :-) Always good to
learn new things. His talk was more business-oriented. I could
understand parts of his talk, but of course I was again
thrilled to learn he is also a programmer \o/

I've always thought that our academics and the enterprise worlds in Brazil had a huge gap between them, but maybe it is slowly changing. Although Kewal mentioned several success cases, I've heard more and more about projects incubated at universities, as well as software being created at local universities. So hopefully this scenario is changing here too.

Most talks mentioned data management, data governance, data quality
and other data-related topics. But there were also talks
mentioning social media and unstructured data, big data, data analysis,
and systems integration. I came to the event with a programmer point of view of data management. But I feel that my awareness about the data management within a company has improved a lot.
