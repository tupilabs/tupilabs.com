[Separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) is a design principle, and 
states that each part of a software addresses a separate concern. Different patterns and abstractions 
can be used for that like MVC, DAOs and repositories.

Repositories help in the abstraction of the data layer. It provides an interface for retrieving data, 
independent of the implementation, acting like a collection of objects.

In [Nestor-QA](http://nestor-qa.org) I had implemented repositories using some Java code I had in my 
mind, without paying too much attention to the abstraction layers. Two weeks ago, while working on some 
complicated issue in Nestor I noticed that the repositories in Nestor had been implemented using the 
Eloquent classes.

Eloquent is a library used in Laravel for data abstraction. It provides access to databases like MySQL 
and SQLite, kind like DAOs (and sometimes like repositories too). However, for Nestor being a test 
management tool, we are trying to be platform and framework independent. Here's the old repository code in 
action: 

{% geshi 'php' %}
class DbProjectRepository implements ProjectRepository {

	public function all()
	{
		return Project::where('project_statuses_id', '<>', 2)->get();
	}

	// ...

}
{% endgeshi %}

As you can see, we were returning the result of the get() method from Eloquent. Another big mistake was 
using these objects in the views. In the end we were not only using data layer elements in the wrong place, 
but we also had many queries to render an UI. 

{% geshi 'php' %}
abstract class DbBaseRepository extends BaseRepository {

	protected $model;

	public function __construct($model)
	{
		$this->model = $model;
	}

	public function all()
	{
		return $this->model->all()->toArray();
	}

	// ...
}
{% endgeshi %}

After searching for a while, I found a [nice example](https://github.com/samgreenwood/swapshop/tree/master/app/Swapshop/Repositories) 
of a class design for repositories, where the return type is always an array. In the views you will 
have the array and keys, and in case someday you decide moving to another framework, you can leave the 
views unchanged (hopefully :-). Neat, no?
