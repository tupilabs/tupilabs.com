                <p>The second day of <strong><a href="http://www.dmc-latam.com">DMC Latam 2013</a></strong> chapter Brazil started and the organizers 
explained that we would have two tracks instead of a single one. 
So far we have had all the talks at the same auditorium, 
with two projectors and enough room for probably about 300 people.</p>
<p>This second track, from what I understood, was included in this 
year&#8217;s event in order to have more technical sessions.</p>
<!-- more -->

<hr />
<p><strong>Janet Lichtenberger</strong>, from <em>Walgreens</em>, was the first speaker. 
Her talk was about her work with data management at Walgreens, 
a corporation with many offices spread over US and 
that is merging with a UK company - IIUC.</p>
<p>Even though at Walgreens data security and integrity are very important, 
I liked that she said that her group tries to influence other departments. 
Right now I&#8217;m working with a team of software architects. And 
being a programmer, I can&#8217;t say I exactly love architects that 
throw a pre-built architecture on your lap and orders you to use 
those API&#8217;s and frameworks, with no further explanation. I belive 
that the influence and stewardship approach probably works better.</p>
<p>Janet also mentioned standards, risk, and policies. And told us 
how these items are applied to data in Walgreens. I imagine that 
what Janet demonstrated during her talk is what it is like to 
work with data management in a big corporation.</p>
<hr />
<p>One more talk before our break fast. Although I wanted to 
practice my talk before lunch, I stayed to watch 
<strong>Leila Martins</strong>&#8216; talk about challenges in data management. 
Leila had over 10 years of experience working with data, 
and ATM she works at Serasa, a credit bureau. As I mentioned 
in <a href="/%5C/2013%5C/08%5C/09%5C/dmc-latam-day-1-report">the day #1 report</a>, I find it interesting 
to learn about what happens in companies where data is 
the main asset, since it drives both IT and business.</p>
<p>After her talk I talked with some <em>geeks</em> from Serasa during 
coffee break, and looks like they have a lot of fun projects, 
good ideas and a talented and motivated team. Ah! And with 
diversity too. One of the smartest guys I met at the event 
was from Serasa, and a bachelor in arts <strong>and</strong> a programmer :D</p>
<hr />
<p>During the coffee break I had the chance to talk with a friend 
of mine, <strong>Ilya Brotzky</strong> from <em>Acxiom</em>. His co-worker, 
<strong>Dalvani Lima</strong>, was giving the next talk and I could exchange 
a few words with him. </p>
<p>Dalvani&#8217;s talk was more focused on applications of data 
management, on how to use the data and make money. One of 
my favorite talks of the day, especially because he mentioned 
Big Data, but emphasized on the need to think carefully 
about your solution. And his slides had very little about 
Acxiom. He mentioned that he wanted to explain how you could 
use data and get more value out of it, and that you 
could use Acxiom solutions and expertise for that, but that you 
could try other solutions or combine different solutions too.</p>
<hr />
<p>Time to move to the other room, to watch the technical sessions. 
There were other talks in parallel, but my next session was 
on <em>data quality</em>, by <strong>Rogerio Carosi</strong> and <strong>Gilberto 
Prados</strong>. They presented a solution that <em>creates matches for 
database registries</em> - IIUC. This way you can use these matches to 
sanitize, filter and transform your data. Looks like they have a 
lot of other services, and that this products has many other 
features. Gilberto is probably the most experienced developer in 
the whole conference. Great talk!</p>
<hr />
<p>Well, the next was <strong>my talk</strong>. I tried to show how to use <em>big data</em> 
and NLP to manipulate unstructured data and feed structured tables. 
Hopefully the audience got introduced to the subject, or simply 
got more interested in applying it with big data.</p>
<hr />
<p>Unfortunately I missed parts of <strong>Marcus Vinicius da Costa</strong>&#8216;s 
talk about data integration and process in e-ping. From what I 
could understand, it is a government department or group, that 
tries to manage the data being used in many different groups 
of the government.</p>
<hr />
<p>My last talk of the day, even though there was another one - had 
to send e-mails and do a quick web conference. </p>
<p>The talk was by <strong>Stan Christiaens</strong>, co-founder of <em>Collibra</em>. 
Stan started his talk with some Brazilian Portuguese words! 
And he even used a very good joke, with the Corinthians 
stadium song <em>Louco por ti Corinthians</em>. I noticed the 
translator laughing out loud in her little cabine :)</p>
<p>Stan used many examples, like Google Maps and Apple Maps to 
denote the need to have good quality data. And raised the 
audience attention to the need to have communication within 
the company and its processes. One of my favorite talks in the 
event.</p>
<hr />
<p>I learned a lot about data management, data governance, 
data quality, big data, data tooling and understood more 
about how IT and business, data management and software 
development are connected.</p>
<p>Met lots of smart and interesting people, and ended the 
day with no business cards :) Hope to be able to participate in 
DMC Latam 2014.</p>
<p>Thanks to all DMC Latam organizers, to all speakers and attendees! 
<strong>DMC Latam 2013 was awesome</strong>!</p>
