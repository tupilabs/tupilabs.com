      <p>It is not exactly an idea, it is more a requirement for <a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a>. A common way of administering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing" title="Batch processing">Batch tasks</a> in computer clusters is using Batch servers such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System" title="PBS">PBS</a>. The process to submit a job consist of executing a shell script with special &#8220;meta&#8221; comments that will tell the PBS about your job priority, CPU&#8217;s needed, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a> has an awesome remoting API, that has been reworked since its first version in Hudson (it was part of the core IIRC), and can be used for other things. There is a Wiki page about <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Monitoring+external+jobs" title="Monitoring external jobs with Jenkins">Monitoring external jobs</a>.</p>

<p>What we would need, is query the PBS server, running qstat + parameters locally in the cluster machine. So the requirements that I see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn more about the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting" title="Jenkins-CI remoting API">remoting</a> API in Jenkins (see <a href="http://kohsuke.org/tag/remoting/" title="Remoting by KK">http://kohsuke.org/tag/remoting/</a> too)</li>
<li>Rework <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pbs4java/" title="pbs4java">pbs4java</a> or use a wrapper to an existing C API (I&#8217;ve read in the past about one, the Python PBS module is a wrapper for this API too)</li>
<li>Learn about this technique for monitoring external jobs mentioned in that Wiki page</li>
<li>Write glue code if needed</li>
<li>Test with a <a href="creating-a-pbsmpi-cluster-for-bioinformatics-part-1/" title="PBS cluster">PBS cluster</a></li>
<li>Report the findings (paper?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Just food for thought :D</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There is a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/label/JENKINS/plugin-cluster" title="plugin-cluster">label in Jenkins Wiki</a> with several plug-ins that could be used for reference</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m working in an <a href="http://nutch.apache.org" title="Apache Nutch">Apache Nutch</a> project that involves some new plug-ins and customization in existing parts parts of Nutch, however, after reading Nutch&#8217;s code base and learning about its plug-in architecture, I believe someone could use part of <a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a> API to enhance the plug-in API in Nutch.</p>
<p>Nutch uses a similar concept, with the same name as in Jenkins, Extension Points. However, it&#8217;s quite hard to create a plug-in project separate from the core project (it uses Ivy and plug-ibs have some dependencies to the core project). And you have to extend certain classes and configure XML files to prepare your plug-in.</p>
<p>Part of this could be automatically done with inheritance + Java annotations. I&#8217;ll have a cycle for Open Source in the next days, and will give it a try to see if that really makes sense.</p>

    <section>
      <p>
 <a href="http://www.speaklikeabrazilian.com" title="Speak Like A Brazilian">Speak Like A Brazilian</a> started as a
 weekend project submitted to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a> and <a
  href="http://www.reddit.com/" title="Reddit">Reddit</a>. There was an amazing feedback and thus we decided to dedicate
 some time to a new version of SLBR. It is a web site to share Brazilian Portuguese expressions with other users.
 Anybody can submit expressions, like or dislike expressions and share the expressions with friends via e-mail or social
 networks.
</p>

<p>
 <strong>TL;DR</strong> We added the feature to have an expression with many definitions, simplified the design of the
 landing page and removed the need to register to submit expressions. Part of the work was based on user feedback, and
 another part was based on the way that <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com" title="Urban Dictionary">Urban
  Dictionary</a> works.
</p>

<h2>What was done?</h2>

<p>We started by the database model. Initially, expressions were thought as a single entity. An expression had a
 text and its description. However, some users pointed that they could have more than one definition for the same
 expression. We had to break the table into two, expressions and definitions.</p>

<p>Time to rethink the landing page design. There are several articles that talk about the landing pages ([1], [2],
 [3]). Here are some basic guidelines that we followed when redesigning SLBR.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Limit action</li>
 <li>Buttons and call actions standing out</li>
 <li>Enable sharing</li>
</ul>

<p style="">
 <a href="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/old_1.png"><img src="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/old_1.png" alt=""
  title="Old version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-607" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Limit action</h3>

<p>The old version had too much text, a video and a box with tweets. As well as the letters menu. We removed this
 content, leaving only the letters menu, minus the Home and Login menu items. Now the user is presented with the search
 box, the letters menu and the top ten expressions.</p>

<p style="">
 <a href="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/new_1.png"><img src="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/new_1.png" alt=""
  title="New Version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-611" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Buttons and call actions standing out</h3>

<p>With less actions on the screen, the user experience will be better in SLBR. When the users sees the landing page
 now, there is the search button standing out, with a bigger font size. There is also a menu with letters with simple
 nagivation, and some expressions that give the users the picture of how the web site works.</p>

<p style="">
 <a href="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/new_2.png"><img src="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/new_2.png" alt=""
  title="New Version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-612" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Enable sharing</h3>

<p>This was a recommendation in one of the web sites mentioned earlier but UD already did that too. A very simple
 idea, and very easy to be put into practice too. We added a form that lets users share an expression via e-mail or via
 social networks. Hopefully it will increase the number of expressions in SLBR.</p>

<p style="">
 <a href="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/new_3.png"><img src="img/posts/2012-08-29_redesigning-speak-like-a-brazilian/new_3.png" alt=""
  title="New Version" width="600" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-613" /></a>
</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>We have also made several changes to the layout of items, and some CSS and JS enhancements, like using hover in
 some elements, modal windows to share and code to prevent a form being submitted twice.</p>

<p>But one of the greatest enhancements was allow users to submit expressions without having to log in. Before this,
 users were required to register in the web site in order to submit expression. That is just boring. After playing with
 UD, we decided to give it a try.</p>

<p>
 We will monitor the web site stats to check the results of this redesign, but so far we are very happy with this new
 version. The next step now is, probably, use <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> to create a simple
 version of the web site for mobile users and promote the web site at local hostels.
</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

 Few weeks ago <em>TupiLabs</em> participated of <em><a href="http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2012"
  title="BOSC 2012">BOSC 2012</a></em> , with a talk about <em><a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a></em>
 . BioUno is a project that applies techniques and tools from Continuous Integration in Bioinformatics, in special <em><a
  href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" title="Jenkins CI">Jenkins</a></em> . In the very beginning, the project was a &#8221; <em>hey,
  look what I can do with Jenkins</em> &#8220;. Later on we defined that we would like to <em>create biology pipelines with
  Jenkins</em> , using plug-ins. This was the topic of our talk in BOSC 2012 - <strong>Creating biology pipelines
  with Jenkins</strong> . The main advantage of using Jenkins, is its <em>distributed environment with master and slaves</em> ,
 the <em>plug-ins</em> and the <em>documentation and community available</em> .
</p>

<p>

  title="BOSC_logo" width="161" height="115" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598" />
</p>

<p>
 In the talk, we showed a demo using vanilla Jenkins, <a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/" title="MrBayes">MrBayes</a>
 , with <a href="https://github.com/tupilabs/mrbayes-plugin" title="mrbayes-plugin">mrbayes-plugin</a> , and <a
  href="http://www.r-project.org/" title="R Project">R</a> and ape for plotting, using <a
  href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/r-plugin" title="r-plugin">r-plugin</a> . It was a very simple pipeline, without
 using Cloud services or any NGS tool. What was great in BOSC 2012 is that we could catch up with people that work on <a
  href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/" title="Galaxy">Galaxy</a> , <a href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/" title="Taverna">Taverna</a>
 , <a href="http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#welcome" title="Mobyle">Mobyle</a> and other workflow management
 systems, as well as lads from other interesting projects, like <a href="http://cloudgene.uibk.ac.at/" title="CloudGene">CloudGene</a>
 (MapReduce interface for researchers, pretty cool). When we returned to Brazil, we had more items to include in BioUno
 TODO list, but also a realization. That BioUno is not only a biology workflow management system. Its roles intersect
 with Galaxy, Taverna and Mobyle, as a <em>workflow management system</em> , but also intersect with <a
  href="http://biohpc.org/" title="BioHPC">BioHPC</a> , as a <em>bioinformatics computer management system</em> .
</p>

 With Jenkins you can start and monitor slaves remotely (in your local network or in a cloud), execute parts of your
 build in one machine and serialize results back to the master, display graphs, monitor usage and execute other things
 that give you the possibility to use Jenkins to <strong>create very customized pipelines</strong> . Sometimes a
 researcher has to use tools like <a href="http://creskolab.uoregon.edu/stacks/" title="stacks">stacks</a> , <a
  href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">samtools</a> , <a href="http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html"
  title="structure">structure</a> , <a href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page" title="Beast">beast</a> and so it
 goes. But sometimes he has need of a very specific routine, maybe for plotting something or adjusting data output from
 one tool, before inputting it into the next tool in the pipeline. <em>These routines are not always worth a tool,
  as they would be used very rarely</em> . This is possible with Jenkins. Or a job may demand five computers. Common computer
 facilities would delegate the machine provision to cluster management systems, like <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System" title="PBS">PBS</a> , <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF" title="LSF">LSF</a> or some <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing" title="Cloud computing">cloud based system</a> . With Jenkins, you
 can manage your computer, maybe even use <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/" title="Puppet">Puppet</a> to help you. We
 have a long way ahead, we are reorganizing our servers at <a
  href="http://www.linode.com/?r=6bd4d380e0421dab1a6ceb40ee0b6379da682de4" title="Linode">Linode</a> to install <a
  href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview" title="JIRA">JIRA</a> and <a
  href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview" title="Confluence">Confluence</a> , and have a more
 Jenkins-like web site (as this is the principal tool in BioUno). And we are still creating plug-ins. If you have any
 interested in the project, feel free to <a href="http://www.biouno.org/contact/" title="Contact BioUno">join us</a> ,
 your help will be very welcome :-)

 While we worked on our <a href="creating-a-pbsmpi-cluster-for-bioinformatics-part-1/"
  title="Creating a PBS/MPI cluster for bioinformatics – Part 1">small internal cluster</a> set up, we used <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System" title="Portable Batch System">PBS</a> for running structure
 jobs in batch. This post has a simple comparison of web applications that can be used for monitoring a PBS cluster.
 This is a very simple comparison, and the information may not be sufficient for you to decide whether you should use it
 or not in your computer facility.
</p>

<p>
 We found tools with a simple query in SourceForge.net. We looked up <em>pbs</em>, and selected three tools. They are <a
  href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pbsclusterviz/?source=directory" title="PBS Viz Cluster">PBS Viz Cluster
  0.6a</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/torquemon/?source=directory" title="Torque Web Monitor">Torque Web
  Monitor 1.0</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/myjam/?source=directory" title="myJAM">myJAM 2.4.7-3191</a>.
 The hardware used is not being taken in account in this comparison, but for what it is worth, we have a Core i5 quad
 core, with 6GB of memory and 400GB disk. The operational system is Debian Squeeze, and the web server an Apache.
